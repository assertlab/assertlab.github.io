The paper “**Social Machines: A Unified Paradigm to Describe Social Web-Oriented Systems**“ authored by Vanilson Burégio, Silvio Meira e Nelson Rosa has been accepted for publication at [The Theory and Practice of Social Machines](http://sociam.org/www2013/) (SOCM2013) co-located with [22nd International World Wide Web Conference](http://www2013.org/) (WWW2013). The conference will be held in May 13th-17th, 2013 at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

A brief overview of the [paper](http://sociam.org/www2013/papers/socm2013_submission_5.pdf) is given next.

_Blending computational and social elements into software has&nbsp;gained significant attention in key conferences and journals. In&nbsp;this context, “Social Machines” appears as a promising model&nbsp;for unifying both computational and social processes. However,&nbsp;it is a fresh topic, with concepts and definitions coming from&nbsp;different research fields, making a unified understanding of the&nbsp;concept a somewhat challenging endeavor. This paper aims to&nbsp;investigate efforts related to this topic and build a preliminary&nbsp;classification scheme to structure the science of Social&nbsp;Machines. We provide a preliminary overview of this research&nbsp;area through the identification of the main visions, concepts, and&nbsp;approaches; we additionally examine the result of the&nbsp;convergence of existing contributions. With the field still in its&nbsp;early stage, we believe that this work can collaborate to the&nbsp;process of providing a more common and coherent conceptual&nbsp;basis for understanding Social Machines as a paradigm.&nbsp;Furthermore, this study helps detect important research issues&nbsp;and gaps in the area._
