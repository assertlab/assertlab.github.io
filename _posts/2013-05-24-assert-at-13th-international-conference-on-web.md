The paper “**USTO.RE: A Private Cloud Storage System**“ authored by Frederico Araújo Durão, Rodrigo Elia Assad, Anderson Fonseca e Silva, José Fernando S. Carvalho, Vinicius Cardoso Garcia and Fernando Antonio Mota Trinta has been accepted for publication at [13th International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE 2013) - Industry track](http://icwe2013.webengineering.org/industryTrack). The conference will be held in July 8-12, 2013 in Aalborg, Denmark.

A brief overview of the paper is given next.

_Cloud computing is a computing model where hardware, platforms and software are seen as services; viz. Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service, respectively. Data as a Service (DaaS) is based on the concept that the product, data in this case, can be provided on demand to the user, regardless of geographic or organizational separation between provider and consumer. DaaS applications are for the most part based on excessive data replication in order to guarantee data availability, which means excessive costs in hardware investments. This white paper presents the specification, implementation and evaluation of a system called USTO.RE which aims to be an effective and low-cost alternative for storing data, thereby mitigating the problem of excessive data replication and thus allows itself to be considered a reliable platform from the perspective of data availability. Evaluation scenarios and the results achieved in our experiments to evaluate the system as well as possible lines for future development will be presented._
