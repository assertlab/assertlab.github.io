The paper “**A Cloud-Based Recommendation Model**" authored by Ricardo Batista Rodrigues, Frederico Durão, Vinicius Garcia, Carlo Silva, Rafael Souza and Rodrigo Assad, has been accepted for presentation at the [7th Euro American Association on Telematics and Information Systems (EATIS 2014)](http://eatis.org/eatis2014/) and for inclusion in the conference proceedings to be published by the ACM Digital Library within its International Conference Proceedings Series (ISBN 978-1-4503-2435-9). The conference is being held in Valparaíso, Chile, April 2-4, 2014.

This research is sponsored by the Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE) grants in the process IBPG-0483-1.03/11.

A brief overview of the paper is given next.

_The technological development we have experienced in recent years has provided exponential growth of the digital universe. This growth has generated a large data volume which is expected to reach almost 8 zettabytes in 2015. A good part of this data is in the cloud, and has surpassed the cognitive abilities of users to analyze such large data sets. Faced with this scenario, we investigate the use of cloud factors able to have a positive influence on generating recommendations. Thus, we present a new, simple model based on cloud features which is associated with the content-based technique of recommendation. The practical applicability of data storage environments in the cloud provides the best use of cloud resources and meets user’s preferences._
