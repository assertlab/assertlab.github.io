Com prazer informamos que o artigo “_**Brazilian Smart Cities: Using a Maturity Model to Measure and Compare Inequality in Cities”**_, de autoria de Ricardo Afonso, Kellyton Brito, Clovis Holanda, Alexandre Alvaro e Vinicius Cardoso Garcia foi aceito como full paper para apresentação oral e publicação na [16th International Digital Government Research Conference (dg.o 2015)](http://dgo2015.dgsociety.org/){:target="_blank"}.

O resumo do artigo diz que:

> Currently there are several publications on smart cities and advances offered to the routine of its inhabitants and resource optimization, however, there is still no consensus on the definition of “Smart Cities”, nor of their domains and indicators. The lack of a clear and widely usable definition and delimitation of areas and indicators makes it difficult to compare or measure cities in this context. This paper compares some of the Brazilian capital indicators and presents a maturity model called br-SCMM (Brazilian Smart City Maturity Model) developed to allow extracted indicators of public databases may be used to assist city managers.
