The paper “**How People Care about Their Personal Data Released on Social Media**“ authored by Kellyton Dos Santos Brito, Frederico Araujo Durão Vinicius Cardoso Garcia and Silvio Romero de Lemos Meira has been accepted for publication at [11th International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust](http://unescoprivacychair.urv.cat/pst2013/). The conference is being held in Tarragona, Catalonia, July 10-12, 2013.

A brief overview of the paper is given next.

_Content sharing services become immensely&nbsp;popular on the Web. More than 1 billion people use this kind of&nbsp;services to communicate with friends and exchange all sorts of&nbsp;information. In this new context, privacy guarantees are essential:&nbsp;guarantees about the potential release of data to unintended&nbsp;recipients and the use of user data by the service provider.&nbsp;Although the general public is concerned about privacy questions&nbsp;related to unintended audiences, data usage by service providers&nbsp;is still misunderstood. In order to further explore this level of&nbsp;misunderstanding, this work presents the results of a survey&nbsp;conducted among 900 people with the aim of discovering how&nbsp;people care about the use of their personal data by service&nbsp;providers in terms of social media. From the results, we found&nbsp;that: (i) in general people do not read license terms and do not&nbsp;know very much about service policies, and when presented with&nbsp;these policies people do not agree with them; (ii) a good number&nbsp;of people would support alternative models such as paying for&nbsp;privacy or selling their personal data; and (iii) there are some&nbsp;differences between generations in relation to how they care&nbsp;about their data._
