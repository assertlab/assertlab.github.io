Two papers has been accepted for publication as Short Paper in the [15th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems](http://www.iceis.org/Home.aspx) (ICEIS).

The first is entitled “**Smart Cities Architectures: A Systematic Review**" and second is "**Synaptic City: An architectural approach using an OSGI Infrastructure and GMaps API to build a City Simulator**". Both papers are authored by Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues Pinto Tomas, Welington Manoel da Silva, Kiev Santos da Gama, Alexandre Alvaro and Vinicius Cardoso Garcia.

The conference will be held in July 4 - 7, 2013 at ESEO, Angers Loire Valley, France.

This activity is one result of the MSc research being done by Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues Pinto Tomas and Welington Manoel da Silva.

A brief overview of the two paper is given next:

“Smart Cities Architectures: A Systematic Review" :&nbsp;

_The smart cities concept arises from the necessity of manage several problems caused by the unbridled population growth at urban centers. To make a city become "smart" it is needed employ Information Technology and Communication (ICT) to access, process and deliver information according to the urban context. This information can be employed to mitigate several urban issues, such as jams, high natural resource consumption, epidemic, sustainability, waste management, low quality and life expectation of citizens, among others. Thus, the need arises to create architecture able to interact with the Internet of Things, i.e., several built-in devices, appliances, sensors and actuators embedded in each urban context. This work is a systematic review regarding proposals for such architectures. After selecting the relevant approaches, we have identified a set of issues that these approaches aim to solve and some architectural patterns employed._

"Synaptic City: An architectural approach using an OSGI Infrastructure and GMaps API to build a City Simulator"

_Big cities have noticeable problems resulting from poor management of urban services. Monitoring a city gives some parameters to evaluate the performance of urban services, allowing to identify their flaws, and elaborate strategic plains to correct them. Smart cities architectures are intended to propose Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) solutions to increase service efectiveness. Considering that to establish a ICT infrastructure to support a smart city architecture is very expensive, once you have got the data and you know what urban service you will attend to, you can use a city simulator to test how the architecture will behave when facing the city's problems. In this context we propose the Synaptic City architecture, together with a city simulator, with which we modeled a Brazilian city, Recife, Pernambuco, in order to discuss its main problems._
