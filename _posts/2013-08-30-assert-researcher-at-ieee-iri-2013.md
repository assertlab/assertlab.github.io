The master degree student, Jackson Raniel Florencio da Silva, was participate of the 14th edition of the [International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration](http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~iri2013/), held 14-16 August in San Francisco, California. Sponsored annually by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the conference serves as a forum for debate on the reuse of information and reusable integration of information systems.

On the occasion, Jackson Raniel presented the paper "The Dynamic Aspects of Product Derivation in DSPL: a Systematic Literature Review", work that is part of the research developed by the group ASSERT Lab during his Masters in Computer Science held at the Center for Informatics (CIn) UFPE. "This is a systematic review of the literature with the aim of identifying how is the derivation of products from dynamic software product lines," says Jackson.

Jackson explains that these product lines involve dynamic programs that adapt to contexts according to stimuli picked up by sensors in the environment around them. Common Applications of these programs can be viewed on mobile devices in systems that need to be available 24 hours a day, in smart homes and telemonitoring of patients at risk.

Among other contributions, the research helps in mapping the state of the art and identification of issues not yet addressed by the scientific community. According to Jackson, the participation in the event and the discussion generated on the subject were very satisfactory. "The discussion was very positive and confirmed the importance of what was discussed," he says. During the event, Jackson was also invited to mediate a session on reuse in software engineering.

This research is sponsored by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) grants in the process 381305/2011-2, by FACEPE grant APQ-1044- 1.03/10. It was also partially supported by the National Institute of Science and Technology for Software Engineering ([INES](http://www.ines.org.br)) , funded by CNPq and FACEPE, grants 573964/2008-4 and APQ-1037-1.03/08. It is also part of UbiStructure - An infrastructure for developing and executing ubiquitous applications - CNPq 14/2011, process number 481417/2011-7.
