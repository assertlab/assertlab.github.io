The paper “**Cloud Testing Framework**”&nbsp;authored&nbsp;by Crescencio Rodrigues Lima Neto (DCC-UFBA and IFBA), and Vinicius Cardoso Garcia (CIn-UFPE), has been accepted for publication at the&nbsp;[17th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering](http://cin.ufpe.br/~ease2013/index.html)&nbsp;(EASE’2013). The conference will be held in April 14 - 16, 2013 at Porto de Galinhas, Brazil.

This activity is part of the project “[Social Machines and Research Team - SMaRT](http://www.ines.org.br/?p=502)” at [INES](http://www.ines.org.br/ "INES") and is one of the results of the research being done by&nbsp;[ASSERT Lab](http://assertlab.com/).

A brief overview of the paper is given next

_Cloud-based testing introduces a new set of challenges. While many companies are approaching cloud computing with cautious, testing appears to be next area of growing interest. This paper propose the development of a new framework focusing on cloud testing. We intend to define the activities, roles, techniques, and tools that will be used in an integrated framework. A research methodology containing all the steps that will be executed during the proposal implementation was defined. A schedule was suggested in order to allow the research development. We propose a new Cloud Testing framework and we present the research methodology and schedule that will be used to implement the proposal._
