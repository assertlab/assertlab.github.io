The paper "**The dynamic aspects of product derivation in DSPL: a systematic literature review**" authored by Jackson Raniel Silva, Francisco Silva, Leandro Nascimento, Dhiego Martins and Vin√≠cius Garcia has been accepted for publication at [14th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration](http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~iri2013/). The conference is being held in San Francisco, USA, August 14-16, 2013.

This research is sponsored by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) grants in the process 381305/2011-2, by FACEPE grant APQ-1044-1.03/10. It was also partially supported by the National Institute of Science and Technology for Software Engineering (INES), funded by CNPq and FACEPE, grants 573964/2008-4 and APQ-1037-1.03/08. It is also part of UbiStructure - An infrastructure for developing and executing ubiquitous applications - CNPq 14/2011, process number 481417/2011-7.

A brief overview of the paper is given next.

_Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have gained significant attention in academic community by involving aspects of product lines and runtime adaptable systems development. Managing dynamic variations demands is a challenge addressed by DSPL paradigm. In this context, this paper introduces the results of a systematic literature review that involved 2,084 studies, with the objective of understanding how the dynamic derivation in DSPL is made. The contributions of this study are: a) an embracing analysis and classification of scientific literature in DSPL area, b) the definition of inputs that are needed to perform the dynamic derivation, c) the description of what composes these inputs, and d) the understanding of the process to perform the dynamic derivation. We conclude that due to the lack of maturity in the dynamic derivation field, there are many open research opportunities still available._
