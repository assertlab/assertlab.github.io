The paper “**Systematic Mapping Study On Security Threats in Cloud Computing**“ authored by Carlo Marcelo Revoredo da Silva, José Lutiano Costa da Silva, Ricardo Batista Rodrigues, Leandro Marques do Nascimento and Vinicius Cardoso Garcia has been accepted for publication at [International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security (IJCSIS)](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;issn=19475500&amp;genre=journal).

A brief overview of the paper is given next.

_Today, Cloud Computing is rising strongly, presenting itself to the market by its main servisse models, known as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, that offer advantages in operational investments by means of on-demand costs, where consumers pay by resources used. In face of this growth, security threats also rise, compromising the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the services provided. Our work is a Systematic Mapping where we hope to present metrics about publications available in literature that deal with some of the seven security threats in Cloud Computing, based in the guide entitled "Top Threats to Cloud Computing" from the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). In our research we identified the more explored threats, distributed the results between fifteen Security Domains and identified the types of solutions proposed for the threats. In face of those results, we highlight the publications that are concerned to fulfill some standard of compliance._
