The paper “**Smart Cities Software Architectures: A Survey**”&nbsp;authored by Welington Manoel da Silva, Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues Pinto Tomas, Kelvin Lopes Dias, Ricardo Alexandre Afonso, Alexandre Alvaro and&nbsp;Vinicius Cardoso Garcia&nbsp;has been accepted for publication in the&nbsp;[Software Architecture: Theory, Technology, and Applications (SA-TTA)&nbsp;Technical Track](http://dinamico2.unibg.it/sa-tta/ "SAC 2013 Track on Software Architecture: Theory, Technology, and Applications (SA-TTA)")&nbsp;at the&nbsp;[28th Symposium On Applied Computing (SAC’2013)](http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2013/ "28th Symposium On Applied Computing").

The conference will be held in March 18 - 22, 2013 at&nbsp;[Institute of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra (ISEC-IPC)](http://www.isec.pt/en/),&nbsp;Coimbra, Portugal.

This activity is part of the project “[Social Machines and Research Team - SMaRT](http://www.ines.org.br/?p=502)” and is one of the results of the MSc research being done by&nbsp;Welington Manoel da Silva and Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues Pinto Tomas and PhD research being done by Ricardo Alexandre Afonso.

A brief overview of the paper is given next

> The smart cities concept arises from the need to manage, automate, optimize and explore all aspects of a city that could be improved. For this purpose it is necessary to build a robust architecture that satisfies a minimal number of requirements such as distributed sensing, integrated management and flexibility.
> 
> Several architectures have been proposed with different goals, but none of them met satisfactorily the needs that permeate smart cities.
> 
> In this work various architectures are discussed, highlighting the main requirements that they aim to fulfill. Furthermore, based on different architectures with the most varied purposes, a set of requirements for the implementation of a smart city is presented and discussed.
