A paper from ASSERT Members has been accepted for publication in the [International Journal of E-Planning Research](http://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-planning-research-ijepr/44994) (IJEPR).

The paper is entitled "I**s Brazilian Open Government Data Actually Open Data? An Analysis of the Current Scenario**", by Kellyton dos Santos Brito, Marcos Antônio da Silva Costa, Vinicius Cardoso Garcia and Silvio Romero de Lemos Meira.

A brief summary of the paper is following:
_Open Government Data (OGD) hold great promise for transforming the efficiency and effectiveness of public services through the ease of publishing and access to government public information or through the offer of new kinds of services, such as smart city services and applications. In this work, we analyze the Brazilian OGD current scenario and the main difficulties and challenges of developing applications using that data. First, we performed an analysis of three Brazilian OGD repositories according to OGD definitions. Then, we interviewed the developers of two similar applications that use the OGD of two main Brazilian cities, were submitted to different cities’ application contests, and were well evaluated in both. Based on the analysis, this work concludes that Brazilian OGD initiatives have to resolve some issues before being considered truly open data for use in application development at large._
