The paper "Accounting Federated Clouds based on the JiTCloud Platform" authored by Francisco Airton, Paulo Silveira, Vinicius Garcia, Fernando Trinta and Rodrigo Assad, has been accepted as a poster for publication at the [13th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing](http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/ccgrid2013) (CCGrid 2013). The symposium will be held in May 13-16, 2013 at Delft, Netherlands.

This activity is part of the project "[JiTCloud - Highly scalable IaaS](http://jitclouds.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/site/)" and is one of the results of the MSc research developed by Francisco Airton.

A brief overview of the paper is given next

_Cloud accounting refers to how cloud usage is recorded and charged. We identified four federated cloud plat-forms which do not include an accounting system. This work presents an accounting mechanism implemented for one of these platforms focused on IaaS. Further, we analyse our proposal in a qualitative fashion._
