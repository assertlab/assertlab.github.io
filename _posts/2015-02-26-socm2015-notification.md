Segue o abstract do artigo:

_Government initiatives to open data to the public are becoming increasingly popular every day. The vast amount of data made available by government organizations yields interesting opportunities and challenges - both socially and technically. In this paper, we propose a social machine-oriented architecture as a way to extend the power of open data and create the basis to derive government as a social machine (Gov-SM). The proposed Gov-SM combines principles from existing architectural patterns and provides a platform of specialized APIs to enable the creation of several other social-technical systems on top of it. Based on some implementation experiences, we believe that deriving government as a social machine can, in more than one sense, collaborate to fully integrate users, developers and crowd in order to participate in and solve a multitude of governmental issues and policy._
